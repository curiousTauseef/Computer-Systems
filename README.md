Course Objectives:
This course is designed to provide students with an understanding of the hierarchy
of abstractions and implementations that comprise a modern computer system. The course is particularly
geared towards topics of interest to a programmer, i.e., topics that aect the performance, correctness, or
utility of user-level programs. Since this investigation is best carried out using the C programming language,
the course will include some instruction in C for programmers familiar with Java.
Prerequisites:
COMP 170. (It is also helpful to have taken COMP 150 and/or 163.)
Textbook:
Randal E. Bryant and David R. O'Halloran.
Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective
.
Pearson Prentice Hall, 2nd edition, 2010.
An optional \recommended" text is: Tomasz Muldner.
C for Java Programmers
. Addison-Wesley,
2000.
Course Requirements:
There will be homework, two tests, and a nal exam. The weightings within the
semester grade will be: Homework: 25%, Tests 1{2: 20% each, and Final exam 35%.
Homework:
Only homework turned in by the due date is guaranteed to be graded. Any special circum-
stances that cause diculty in meeting the deadlines should be brought to the attention of the instructor
in advance. Homework must be handed in at the beginning of class, since solutions may be discussed in
the same class on occasion. Homework will generally be submitted through a specied online mechanism.
Anything that does get submitted on paper would need to go under the door of my oce before class.
Exams:
The midterm exams, tentatively scheduled for week 7 and week 13, are 50 minutes long. The nal
exam is scheduled for 9:00{11:00am on Monday, December 8.
Collaboration:
No
collaboration is permitted on exams.
Collaboration
on homework is acceptable, but
copying
is not! (Safeguard your les and printouts.) You may discuss solution techniques with other students,
but you must write up your solutions independently. If you obtain a solution through research, e.g., in the
library, credit your source and write up the solution in your own words.
