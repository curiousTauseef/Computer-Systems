Course Objectives:
This course is designed to provide students with an understanding of the hierarchy
of abstractions and implementations that comprise a modern computer system. The course is particularly
geared towards topics of interest to a programmer, i.e., topics that aect the performance, correctness, or
utility of user-level programs. Since this investigation is best carried out using the C programming language,
the course will include some instruction in C for programmers familiar with Java.
